# Area-of-Circle-Rectangle-and-Triangle by Gabriel Perez

This program will calculate the area of a circle, rectangle, and triangle. This program will run as 
long as the user enters 'y' or 'Y' to run the program. If the user enters 'n' or 'N' when asked, the program
will terminate. To calculate the area of a circle, rectangle, and triangle, the program will not accept
negative numbers. If a negative number is entered, the user will get an error and will be asked to try
again.

To calculate the area of a circle, the program will ask the user to input the radius of the circle.
Once the radius of the circle is entered, the program will calculate and display the area of the circle
on the monitor.

To calculate the area of a rectangle, the program will ask the user to input the length and width of
the rectangle. Once the length and width of the rectangle is entered, the program will calculate and
display the area of the rectangle on the monitor.

To calculate the area of a triangle, the program will ask the user to input the length of the 3 
different sides of a trianngle. Once the user inputs the lengths of the 3 sides, the program will
verify that the 3 sides inputted make a valid triangle. 

In order to make a valid triangle, Side 1 plus Side 2 should be greater than or equal to Side 3. Side 2 plus Side
3 should be greater than or equal to Side 1. Finally, Side 1 plus Side 3 should be greater than or equal to Side 2. If
any of these three is incorrect, the user will get an error with an explanation and will have to try again.

Once the user enters a valid triangle, the program will calculate the area of the triangle inputted and display the area
of the triangle on the monitor.
